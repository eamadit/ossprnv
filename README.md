An open source streaming platform with real number of views and which remunerates content creators

Dear user of falsely legal streaming,

The development of the internet has been faster and will always be faster than the evolution of laws and contracts. Music and movies have been illegally distributed on the internet thanks to the Fraunhofer compressed formats (mpeg). The rights holders reacted badly by wanting to go back on the right to private copy, by controlling users with aggressive illegal techniques such as Sony rootkits. Streaming players did not respect web standards and still relied on the public key infrastructure of the DNS and corrupted TLDs such as .be. As a result, view counters have always suffered the consequences of MITM attacks. A parallel trade of views has developed. Hackers pretended to sell bots while they sold MITM attacks in their own businesses. The displayed goal of some has always been to destroy culture to push technocrats. The rights holders have all converged towards unequal and illegal digital distribution with improvised cross deals. Companies like Believe Digital with their Zimbalam product started to openly rip off independents who don't have insiders to check their views and royalty accounts. It's still the same today except that there are companies like OneRPM and Amuse that sometimes distribute for free but purposely leave flaws in their systems so they can be hacked. Intellectual property will never be respected again by anyone, unless there is a massive collective awakening around the proposals on github.com/eamadit

No more respect of intellectual property means no more culture. No more culture means no more memory. No more memory means no more brain. No more brain means no more work. No more work means no more money. No more money means no more life.

OSSPRNV has an eternal storage policy. In order to limit storage of low-quality content, OSSPRNV has a quality indicator combining machine learning on cheating techniques, number of views, social interaction, user data and other high quality data to determine the disk space of each user like an elitist algorithm with a minimum of 1GB. OSSPRNV also allows to upload audio files, the user can upload a picture to replace the video. The royalties are calculated according to the number of views and the social interaction verifications.
